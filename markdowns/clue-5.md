## Clue 5

We have intel that our perp stayed in a great spot for New Years Eve 2020 and couldn't help but leave a review. We also received a tip that they went by the false name "Amy" when leaving this review.

Find the above described review in the `reviews` table, and then find the first character of the `name` of the associated listing as a clue.

Use the `listings` and `reviews` tables.

The intended solution involves a [subquery](https://sqlbolt.com/topic/subqueries), but it can be solved in pieces.

Make sure to write down the `id` of the Airbnb listing and the first character of the `name`!
