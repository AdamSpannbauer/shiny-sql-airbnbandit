## Clue 2

The AirbnBandit was reported by our most loyal host (they've been with us the longest `<3`\*).  The report was at their oldest listing\*\*.

Find the `name` of the listing described above.  Write down the first *character* of the `name` as a clue (spaces and symbols count as characters).

Use the `listings` table.

<hr align="left" width="60%">

\*Don't use the `id` to find the oldest host! There is a specific field in the database to indicate how long hosts have been with us.

\*\*The `id` column can be used to find the listing's relative age, the smaller the `id` the older the listing.

***Dates are stored as character; if you want to do SQL date operations (not needed here), you'll need to cast to date

<hr align="left" width="60%">

Make sure to write down the `id` of the Airbnb listing and the first character of the `name`!
