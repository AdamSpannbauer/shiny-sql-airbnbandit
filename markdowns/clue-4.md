## Clue 4

Our evil mastermind was reported in Southeast Asheville.  They needed to book quickly, so only consider listings that were instantly bookable\*.

Find the furthest south listing that's instantly bookable*. If there are ties for the furthest south use the one furthest east. Take the first two *characters* of the matching listings's `name` as a clue (spaces and symbols count as characters).

Make sure to write down the `id` of the Airbnb listing and the first two characters of the `name`!
